Well a video game I like is Pokemon, it has a simplistic charm that I can enjoy when wanting to play a relaxing game. 
Secondly the mechanics are easy to understand and type matchups are easy to learn.
Third is the decent challenge and team combinations for various pokemon.
While the story and graphics can be hit or miss, it's overall a good experience.
Music is also another thing, I personally don't listen to pokemon music but I must admit that some songs are pretty good.
So overall a mainline pokemon game is enjoyable and if you don't know what I mean.
You should play a pokemon game, now.

Whenever I need to search up something online whenever I have a question or don't know about something.
And technology (aka Computer Science ) is used for a lot of things such as: Google, Social Media, GPS, Online Banking, Voice assistances like Siri or Alexa, etc.
Well without it, everything as we know would atler and change drastically and dramatically, if this was real here's what it would be like: if uou need to look up something; you would need a book or map, banking would be more old fashion, when wanting to listen to music; you would need to go to either a concert or damn well have someone recreate it, entertainment would most certianly be different than now a days, etc.
So overall, Computer Science is a major thing in our everyday lives whether we recognize it or not.

Pros: Ai has plenty of things that help us for example: gaming studios needing an ai system to help run their world and test it and make sure it can detect cheaters, Google, VPNs, Grammerly, Instant communication, etc.
It has many benefits and is a stronghold in our world, however..
Cons:There are many big companies and cyber criminals that steal and trade your data and informination without your consent, plus malware, scams, spam emails, viruses etc. 
There is no shortages of bad things that come with ai and I wouldn't blame people for thinking ai is a double edged sword, because that's what I believe it truly comes down to the person or people using it. 
It became a tool of destuction or a haven for us.

One positive impact it has done are ads, they help give us reasons why we should vote this person and what they will do for us.
However, on the other hand, they could be falsely spreading information about their competitors and if they don't know how to make an ad, they could lose the election.
Now I can get into detail of various other things but overall, it has had a positive change on the election.
