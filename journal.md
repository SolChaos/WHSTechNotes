Well a video game I like is Pokemon, it has a simplistic charm that I can enjoy when wanting to play a relaxing game. 
Secondly the mechanics are easy to understand and type matchups are easy to learn.
Third is the decent challenge and team combinations for various pokemon.
While the story and graphics can be hit or miss, it's overall a good experience.
Music is also another thing, I personally don't listen to pokemon music but I must admit that some songs are pretty good.
So overall a mainline pokemon game is enjoyable and if you don't know what I mean.
You should play a pokemon game, now.
