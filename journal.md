Well a video game I like is Pokemon, it has a simplistic charm that I can enjoy when wanting to play a relaxing game. 
Secondly the mechanics are easy to understand and type matchups are easy to learn.
Third is the decent challenge and team combinations for various pokemon.
While the story and graphics can be hit or miss, it's overall a good experience.
Music is also another thing, I personally don't listen to pokemon music but I must admit that some songs are pretty good.
So overall a mainline pokemon game is enjoyable and if you don't know what I mean.
You should play a pokemon game, now.

For Github journals entries, it wasn't too hard honestly, all you need is a bit of guideance and you're good.
Your instructions were clear and easy to follow and overall good.
And I have nothing else to say, peace.

Whenever I need to search up something online whenever I have a question or don't know about something.
And technology (aka Computer Science ) is used for a lot of things such as: Google, Social Media, GPS, Online Banking, Voice assistances like Siri or Alexa, etc.
Well without it, everything as we know would atler and change drastically and dramatically, if this was real here's what it would be like: if uou need to look up something; you would need a book or map, banking would be more old fashion, when wanting to listen to music; you would need to go to either a concert or damn well have someone recreate it, entertainment would most certianly be different than now a days, etc.
So overall, Computer Science is a major thing in our everyday lives whether we recognize it or not.

1:Game Designer.
2:Developing concepts,designing and improving,collaborating,testing and debugging,documenting, and improving processes.
3:Understanding of art,modeling,texting,rigging,animation,progamming,collaborting,and creative mindset.
4:Bachelor's degree in computer science, video game design, or another related field.
5:Senior designer or lead designer.
6:Personally, I just like video games and I want to express my ideas and imagination in anyway possible.

# October 15, 2024
1:Coding requires long term memory use when making something and when planning ahead, thus that can be translated into daily tasks.
2:It most gives you an understanding of teamwork, getting something done in time crunches, have an eye for catching mistakes,etc.
3:It has try to immerse yourself into your imagination or world your creating and what it follows, plus coding requires multiple people working and having various ideas from many people can help relief some stress.
In conclusion, coding has it's benefits even when you're not doing it.

# October 21, 2024
Pros: Ai has plenty of things that help us for example: gaming studios needing an ai system to help run their world and test it and make sure it can detect cheaters, Google, VPNs, Grammerly, Instant communication, etc.
It has many benefits and is a stronghold in our world, however..
Cons:There are many big companies and cyber criminals that steal and trade your data and informination without your consent, plus malware, scams, spam emails, viruses etc. 
There is no shortages of bad things that come with ai and I wouldn't blame people for thinking ai is a double edged sword, because that's what I believe it truly comes down to the person or people using it. 
It became a tool of destuction or a haven for us.

# October 28, 2024
One positive impact it has done are ads, they help give us reasons why we should vote this person and what they will do for us.
However, on the other hand, they could be falsely spreading information about their competitors and if they don't know how to make an ad, they could lose the election.
Now I can get into detail of various other things but overall, it has had a positive change on the election.

# November 4, 2024
1:Because if you don't, there are plenty of big companies and hackers that will steal and sell away your data all for a quick buck.
2:First off, a vpn that is actually trusted and works.
3:For me, not really as I know better than to do something like that.
4:You could have a complex password or login for your very important data or antivirus,while allowing the data you want spread and shown be only that.

# November 12, 2024
1:Many companies have released games, movies, and shows recently, this relates to us because; alright I'ma be real, there's not really a good way to say these events relate to us that much, overall not many events relate to us besides it coming from a bunch of developers and creators.
2:On how these could improve is, well so far, most of it has been good and continue to be as long as they know what they are doing. Plus technology will continue to evolve so much and that's it, bye.

# November 18, 2024
Well for starters, technology has allowed us to transport more food and allow a lot more farmers, fishers, and ranchers to give out their products. It also allows fast food places to deliver more of their food to other places, thus another way to sell their grub. The one thing I can imagine it being bad is errors on relying purely on technology as there are many cases where ai failed to deliver meals all because of simple things such as parallel parking, or putting people out of job. So I think it's best that we don't overrely on technology and still have human production and influence on the industry.

# December 2, 2024
So synthetic biology is a field of science that manipulates the genetic material or material of organisms to design and create new biological systems. Here's what I think, it has both potential, but also consequences. First off, while it can create new things for us as we continue to live in world of climate change, however, if we're not careful, we could accidentally create a virus or worse. As how this could help me in game design and programming, it could help me in world design/layout. as for ethical concerns, this needs to be heavily monitered and studied before experimenting all willy nilly.

# December 9, 2024 
Brain rot is a slang term that perceives stupidity of mindless online content. As for me personally I avoid brain rot and watch more typical youtube videos such as sprite fights and Pokemon and so far it's been positive for me. As for those runner-up words, they have absoulety zero connection to me. It is absolutely possible to avoid brain rot and balance meaningful engagement with technology, I have been doing this.

# December 16, 2024 
Absolutely, not only do I get two weeks off from school, but also Christmas, going to California, plenty of free time, new games to maybe play, and more. I'm gonna love it plus I may play some VR that my cousins has. So yeah,I am definitely looking forward to winter break.

# January 8, 2025
1:I enjoyed messing around with the controls and playing with the things I made.
2:I want to make a sprite fighting game that works and is good.
3:I'm interested in becoming a game creator; and I feel like I'll need some help and a program that can handle and make my dream game, a reality.

# January 13, 2025
I think there's both pros and cons. Firstly better ai can teach it to be more human-like and that in turn can allow it to understand emotions, personal struggles, and more understandable. But the con is such a thing will take way longer then a simple months but entire years, and people overall still far exceed ai and we need people to not handle and control ai, but to also do everything as whether you want to admit or not it's people not to lay dozens of people for just an ai that's still in it's toddler stages. As for how I prepare myself, I'll keep myself ahead of the game and more experience in the industry thus a greater chance of staying and keeping a job because I'm a valiuable asset to whatever company I'm working for.

# January 22, 2025
Well it can impact in big ways such as bans, the lifting or enforcing of new rules, or even limiting how much that companies can provide it's users. As for how Tiktok can keep it's users safe, is appling things such as VPNs, firewalls, and encrypting data and code. A policy of having all users in a encrypted database and they are not allowed to ever sell or use your data. Well in the future, I can find true VPNs and apply them to all my important data.

1: They create a trajectory-planning system and choose a safe path forward.
2:Automate routine tasks.
3:This can cause errors at best and destructive malfunctions at worst.
4:It's possible but I can't give a clear answer due to not knowing the full story and what caused the plane to actually crash.
5:Yes, unless the airport is willing to made their code encrypited and have several passcodes or firewalls to ensure that any would be hackers wouldn't be able to easily access it.
6:It can be used to safeguard and block out any future hackers, malware, or killcodes.

I guess I have to say it's the video where I customize the layout interface. The reason I choose that one is because during the first part of Unity, it was a bit uncommon for me to be told I had to change the interface, rather than position of the scene.

# February 24, 2025
Well... on some level yes I think technology should be aware of slang, we already have shorten slang words such as: Idk, asap, lol, k, gg, etc.
For potential benefits, it would allow ai to keep up with modern times or the newest generation; as for challenges it could alter its course to evolving in a certain direction plus actually teaching it new slang.
As for teachers, I feel like they should at least somewhat aware of slang in order to catch what some students are saying, however they shouldn't fully embrace it some of it does come from brain-rot. 
Plus the last thing we need is schools doing is trying to "fit in" as nobody wants that, as they wouldn't even have much of clue how to act like us, nor can they group everyone as one group as that's not how it works.

For me, I mostly was on my phone and TV and what apps I was using most:Crunchyroll, Poly Buzz, and Youtube. I used these apps to entertain me, as for how, Crunchyroll I used to watch MHA, Youtube for whatever I wanted to catch up on or watch, and Poly Buzz to play. As for how any of this stuff can help me in today's class, it really doesn't help connect to the technology I'm using for today's class.

# March 24, 2025
For me personally, I don't watch basketball nor any sport in particular, so asking me about my viewing expericence of it is basically irrelevant. For how could effect other people who do watch, I like to imagine that the new technology has both positive and negative potential effects. For the positive, if we advance motion sensors, we can best count up how many points the team gets based on the footage from cameras, but also locatiion with motion sensorys sensing when a ball is being thrown and if it lands in the hoop. However, for the negative, it might not even detect perfectly let alone it could be expolited to get the most amount of points out of it, thus causinng an explotation of the system. so it really just depends on what new technology they add.

# March 31, 2024
1:I'm currently mentally,emotionally, and physically stable as I am right now.
2: The most stressful is the impending STAAR test and the sheets of homework I'm getting lobbed at with the only time I have to do them is Wedesday, Friday, and the weekend.
3:Just solve each thing one step at a time and focus on the ones I turn in now to make time for the ones with no immedeate due date.
4:Complete as much Unity as I can.
5:Well........I don't really have anyone I talk to about this, just preferring to keep this to myself to not cause worry or burden others with thoughts I need help all the time now, which yes sometimes I do want to lean into someone I trust and relax until I'm comfortable to continue my own work, as I am pretty independent in that regard where I using prefer to do it alone as I want to get better and not drag people down with my problems. 

# April 7, 2025
Well for me, it being able to show me how to solve the question step by step and understand emotion. Would I use an ai tutor, maybe? I never had much reason to but I guess it's nice when I need to be reminded on how to solve an equation. Plus an ai tutor that shows you step by step on how to solve a problem is easier than flat out saying the answer as it can teach others to problem solve better than just getting answers and copy paste.

# April 14, 2025
I feel like banning phones outright, is such a bad idea, not just for students but also for teachers, let me explain. If you ban phones for students, they be understandably mad and having teahcer not be affected by this rule will cause students to want to revolt, think about it, there are over hundreds of students in a given school compared to a few dozen faculty members, do you even think the adults stand a chance in a brawl, not even close. If this was implented in our school, I absoluetly would be livid, as phone restriction is already strict enough with some class, we don't need to ban them, as I will completely tear down the teachers who do have their phone out despite the ban and make sure they learn.

Dear Coach Gonzales, 
I wanted to thank you for allowing me to constantly go do my business almost everyday and even occasionally encouraging me when I'm doing laps, it may be simple but still I apperciate simplicity and everytime I'm in gym, I feel a lot more comfortable due to it being so big and open meaning when I want, I go for run and actually get a workout, but also the fact it's mostly a chill place where everyone can do whatever they want, play, relax, chat, etc. 
Sincerely, Gabriel Noel Bentzen

Claim: I believe 100 men could beat a silverback gorilla.
Evidence:Silverback Gorillas commonly lack long term endurance in while fighting, can only last for a few minutes, even with adrenaline. Meanwhile people can have adrenaline that can last up to an hour with the average human endurance lasting up to 10-20 minutes in a intense situation while Silverback Gorillas can only last 3-5 minutes. Plus unlike a Silverback, humans can actually stragetize while Silverback Gorilla relies only on instincts and not thinking. Additionally, not all 100 men are gonna charge in, thus letting others know what not to do; and they can simple tag in and out when one person gets knocked back with they're being a reason why humanity has managed to survive and put down much stronger beasts due to our minds and numbers.
Reason:All this means that 100 men could win given the many examples of evidence.

# May 13, 2025
Claim: It is not ethical due to it being dangerous and costly.
Evidence: If you were to hold it right as it would explode and combust, severel things will happen, firstly the fire can burn you, shrapnel can fly out and on you, thus causing bleeding. Next is the cost, no matter what is it, computers are expensive and it's highly unlikely a high school student has the money to pay it off, and they should be reminded that they will pay for the computer.
Reason: This evidence shows why students shouldn't do this challenge.

# May 19, 2025
I am absolutely hype for summer. I can do whatever I want and do things I've been wanting to do but never could due to school time restrants. Such as watching more anime, working out more, learning how to cook, and even hang out with my friend outside of school. 

# September 2, 2025
Claim:My stance on the new phone ban is that government fully didn't think about everything. Evidence: If you were forced to not go something that you enjoy for 8 hours including your break, which should be your time and peace, wouldn't you feel that the law is clearly flawed in that area. Reason: Think about, normally you'd agree to saying you choose prioritze work when you're on the clock, but when you're off the clock, shouldn't you be allowed to spend yoour freetime however you choose? so why should have to continue following a rule when I'm on my break and not on my work, the lunchtime is supposed to be my time of peace of only 30 minutes, but I guess Texas doesn't give a damn about who or what you are or the situtation, they simply prefer complete control over any semblence of free will.

The dream career I want is game designer because of my love for storytelling and gaming. Computer science is literally a requirement for this field of work given it falls into this catergory. I got three whole examples on how and why computer science is necessary for my job. First off, knowledge in coding,progamming,and 3D modeling; when you become a game designer you will be questioned on your ability to create,code,and program because you will be also working on the specific video game you're helping to create. Second off, knowledge on data analysis; this is needed to understand player behavior and then using this dat to inform design choices. And finally, problem-solving; you'll need to understand how computer science works when updating and fixing glitches in new patches of the code/game, in order for players to enjoy your game more.

# September 15, 2025
Well with the many problems in our world, I believe this idea of mine can help solve two birds with one stone. My idea is firstly to entirely crack down corruption and racism inside the police force, which should be protecting the innocent, not capturing them. My first method is to test all our police officers with a lie detector and interviewing them with a series of questions that increasing get more difficult and dark, while it's not a complete 100% solution, it should dimnish corruption and racism as not only you'll see what your officer's true colors are but also their mindset in a given situation. This can test them mentally on how well they'll do in a dark or simple situation. And we can attach are the factors of a lie detector to an ai for a faster and more detailed analysis of the individual(s). Plus this can help show what cops we want actaully helping the community and this idea is a stepping stone for solving crime. As for how we can better stop crime, we can use technology to add cameras in more open areas such as the roads, abandonded areas, streets, etc, at multiple angles for a better viewing with added night vision to these cameras so we can see crime happen even in the dark. And using an ai to compile multiple sets of cameras and footage for each area and time, we can have it show us each individual frame and enhanced quality, zoomed in shots. All the factors won't be a guarntee, but they should at least lessen the issue on crime and using other technology like DNA tests and more will also be needed on truly cracking down on crime at an efficent/successful rate.

Okay, a couple things wrong about this whole virtual store on Roblox. Firstly, given everything that's happpening with Roblox, I feel like the last thing you wanna do is be associated as a partner for Roblox. But ignoring the obvious red flag there, there's still problems with the concept and probably execution.There's many things that can go wrong such as money getting lost or hacked, people exploiting the very system with a cheat, or simply the stupidity of this idea. At least for Youtubers or streamers, you still got to put the work in to make a video successful or at least profitable, meanwhile this is straight awful because when going back to my example eariler, there's still multiple factors when it comes to before even getting your paycheck. There are better ways to show a kid or teenager how a job really works, and that's by offering them internships to various location where they can get experince for the thing they want or something that's a part of it's catergory. In short, don't support this idea, it's bad, it's flawed, and it's stupid.

# September 30, 2025
The meme originates from NBA. It means "leaving quickly" or "get lost". LaMelo Ball posted 67 in a tweet in it went viral. And soon this spreaded fast like brainrot. I for one am not a part of this trend as I've been heavily against stupid trends and brainrot. So thankfully nothing bad, just another passing trend ready to die off in a few months.
