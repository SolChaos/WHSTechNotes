Well a video game I like is Pokemon, it has a simplistic charm that I can enjoy when wanting to play a relaxing game. 
Secondly the mechanics are easy to understand and type matchups are easy to learn.
Third is the decent challenge and team combinations for various pokemon.
While the story and graphics can be hit or miss, it's overall a good experience.
Music is also another thing, I personally don't listen to pokemon music but I must admit that some songs are pretty good.
So overall a mainline pokemon game is enjoyable and if you don't know what I mean.
You should play a pokemon game, now.

Whenever I need to search up something online whenever I have a question or don't know about something.
And technology (aka Computer Science ) is used for a lot of things such as: Google, Social Media, GPS, Online Banking, Voice assistances like Siri or Alexa, etc.
Well without it, everything as we know would atler and change drastically and dramatically, if this was real here's what it would be like: if uou need to look up something; you would need a book or map, banking would be more old fashion, when wanting to listen to music; you would need to go to either a concert or damn well have someone recreate it, entertainment would most certianly be different than now a days, etc.
So overall, Computer Science is a major thing in our everyday lives whether we recognize it or not.

1:Game Designer.
2:Developing concepts,designing and improving,collaborating,testing and debugging,documenting, and improving processes.
3:Understanding of art,modeling,texting,rigging,animation,progamming,collaborting,and creative mindset.
4:Bachelor's degree in computer science, video game design, or another related field.
5:Senior designer or lead designer.
6:Personally, I just like video games and I want to express my ideas and imagination in anyway possible.

1:Coding requires long term memory use when making something and when planning ahead, thus that can be translated into daily tasks.
2:It most gives you an understanding of teamwork, getting something done in time crunches, have an eye for catching mistakes,etc.
3:It has try to immerse yourself into your imagination or world your creating and what it follows, plus coding requires multiple people working and having various ideas from many people can help relief some stress.
In conclusion, coding has it's benefits even when you're not doing it.

Pros: Ai has plenty of things that help us for example: gaming studios needing an ai system to help run their world and test it and make sure it can detect cheaters, Google, VPNs, Grammerly, Instant communication, etc.
It has many benefits and is a stronghold in our world, however..
Cons:There are many big companies and cyber criminals that steal and trade your data and informination without your consent, plus malware, scams, spam emails, viruses etc. 
There is no shortages of bad things that come with ai and I wouldn't blame people for thinking ai is a double edged sword, because that's what I believe it truly comes down to the person or people using it. 
It became a tool of destuction or a haven for us.

One positive impact it has done are ads, they help give us reasons why we should vote this person and what they will do for us.
However, on the other hand, they could be falsely spreading information about their competitors and if they don't know how to make an ad, they could lose the election.
Now I can get into detail of various other things but overall, it has had a positive change on the election.

1:Because if you don't, there are plenty of big companies and hackers that will steal and sell away your data all for a quick buck.
2:First off, a vpn that is actually trusted and works.
3:For me, not really as I know better than to do something like that.
4:You could have a complex password or login for your very important data or antivirus,while allowing the data you want spread and shown be only that.

1:Many companies have released games, movies, and shows recently, this relates to us because; alright I'ma be real, there's not really a good way to say these events relate to us that much, overall not many events relate to us besides it coming from a bunch of developers and creators.
2:On how these could improve is, well so far, most of it has been good and continue to be as long as they know what they are doing. Plus technology will continue to evolve so much and that's it, bye.

Well for starters, technology has allowed us to transport more food and allow a lot more farmers, fishers, and ranchers to give out their products. It also allows fast food places to deliver more of their food to other places, thus another way to sell their grub. The one thing I can imagine it being bad is errors on relying purely on technology as there are many cases where ai failed to deliver meals all because of simple things such as parallel parking, or putting people out of job. So I think it's best that we don't overrely on technology and still have human production and influence on the industry.

So synthetic biology is a field of science that manipulates the genetic material or material of organisms to design and create new biological systems. Here's what I think, it has both potential, but also consequences. First off, while it can create new things for us as we continue to live in world of climate change, however, if we're not careful, we could accidentally create a virus or worse. As how this could help me in game design and programming, it could help me in world design/layout. as for ethical concerns, this needs to be heavily monitered and studied before experimenting all willy nilly.

Brain rot is a slang term that perceives stupidity of mindless online content. As for me personally I avoid brain rot and watch more typical youtube videos such as sprite fights and Pokemon and so far it's been positive for me. As for those runner-up words, they have absoulety zero connection to me. It is absolutely possible to avoid brain rot and balance meaningful engagement with technology, I have been doing this.

Absolutely, not only do I get two weeks off from school, but also Christmas, going to California, plenty of free time, new games to maybe play, and more. I'm gonna love it plus I may play some VR that my cousins has. So yeah,I am definitely looking forward to winter break.

# January 8, 2025
1:I enjoyed messing around with the controls and playing with the things I made.
2:I want to make a sprite fighting game that works and is good.
3:I'm interested in becoming a game creator; and I feel like I'll need some help and a program that can handle and make my dream game, a reality.

# January 13, 2025
I think there's both pros and cons. Firstly better ai can teach it to be more human-like and that in turn can allow it to understand emotions, personal struggles, and more understandable. But the con is such a thing will take way longer then a simple months but entire years, and people overall still far exceed ai and we need people to not handle and control ai, but to also do everything as whether you want to admit or not it's people not to lay dozens of people for just an ai that's still in it's toddler stages. As for how I prepare myself, I'll keep myself ahead of the game and more experience in the industry thus a greater chance of staying and keeping a job because I'm a valiuable asset to whatever company I'm working for.

# January 22, 2025
Well it can impact in big ways such as bans, the lifting or enforcing of new rules, or even limiting how much that companies can provide it's users. As for how Tiktok can keep it's users safe, is appling things such as VPNs, firewalls, and encrypting data and code. A policy of having all users in a encrypted database and they are not allowed to ever sell or use your data. Well in the future, I can find true VPNs and apply them to all my important data.

1: They create a trajectory-planning system and choose a safe path forward.
2:Automate routine tasks.
3:This can cause errors at best and destructive malfunctions at worst.
4:It's possible but I can't give a clear answer due to not knowing the full story and what caused the plane to actually crash.
5:Yes, unless the airport is willing to made their code encrypited and have several passcodes or firewalls to ensure that any would be hackers wouldn't be able to easily access it.
6:It can be used to safeguard and block out any future hackers, malware, or killcodes.
